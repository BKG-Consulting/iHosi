## 🔌 Integration Guide

### Using the New Scheduler

The modern scheduler is now the **default** in the doctor dashboard:

```tsx
// Automatically available at:
Doctor Dashboard → Scheduling Tab (with "New" badge)
```

### Backward Compatibility

Old scheduling tools preserved in "Legacy" tab:
```tsx
// Still accessible at:
Doctor Dashboard → Legacy Tab
  ├── Schedule Setup (old form-based)
  └── Smart Scheduler (old grid-based)
```

### API Compatibility

Uses existing APIs - **no backend changes required**:
- ✅ `PUT /api/doctors/{id}/schedule` - Save availability
- ✅ `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}` - Update appointment
- ✅ `POST /api/appointments/action` - Accept/reject appointments

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **New Patient Scheduling** - Currently simplified (shows alert)
   - **Reason:** Requires patient database integration
   - **Workaround:** Schedule from pending appointments
   - **Fix:** Will implement patient search in next update

2. **Page Reload After Schedule** - One instance remains
   - **Where:** After confirming appointment in modal
   - **Reason:** Ensures fresh data from server
   - **Future:** Will use optimistic updates + WebSocket

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Partially implemented
   - **Available:** Arrow keys for calendar navigation
   - **Missing:** Global shortcuts (N for new, T for today, etc.)
   - **Future:** Will add in Phase 2
