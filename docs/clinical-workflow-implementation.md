# Clinical Workflow Implementation Plan

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ What We Have
- Patient registration with medical history
- Appointment scheduling system
- Basic medical records structure
- Vital signs collection
- Lab test management
- Diagnosis tracking

### ❌ What We Need to Add

## 1. Pre-Appointment Phase

### A. Patient Intake Forms
- **Symptom Questionnaires** (chief complaint, history of present illness)
- **Medication Lists** (current medications, dosages, frequency)
- **Allergy Documentation** (drug allergies, food allergies, environmental)
- **Family History** (genetic predispositions, hereditary conditions)
- **Social History** (smoking, alcohol, occupation, lifestyle)

### B. Pre-Appointment Screening
- **Insurance Verification** (coverage status, copay, pre-authorization)
- **Appointment Preparation** (fasting instructions, medication restrictions)
- **Consent Forms** (treatment consent, data sharing, HIPAA)

## 2. Pre-Consultation Phase (Nursing)

### A. Check-in Process
- **Patient Arrival** (check-in time, wait time tracking)
- **Insurance Verification** (copay collection, coverage confirmation)
- **Consent Verification** (treatment consent, data sharing)

### B. Nursing Assessment
- **Chief Complaint Documentation** (primary reason for visit)
- **Vital Signs Collection** (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.)
- **Medication Reconciliation** (current vs. prescribed medications)
- **Allergy Verification** (drug allergies, reactions)
- **Pain Assessment** (pain scale, location, duration)

### C. Pre-Consultation Orders
- **Routine Lab Orders** (CBC, CMP, lipid panel if needed)
- **Diagnostic Tests** (X-rays, EKG if indicated)
- **Specialized Tests** (based on symptoms/age)

## 3. Consultation Phase (Doctor)

### A. Chart Review
- **Pre-consultation Data Review** (vitals, labs, questionnaires)
- **Previous Visit History** (last appointment, ongoing issues)
- **Medication Review** (current medications, adherence)

### B. Clinical Assessment
- **History Taking** (detailed symptom history)
- **Physical Examination** (systematic examination)
- **Clinical Decision Making** (differential diagnosis)
- **Treatment Planning** (medications, lifestyle, follow-up)

### C. Documentation
- **SOAP Notes** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
- **ICD-10 Coding** (diagnosis codes)
- **CPT Coding** (procedure codes)
- **Prescription Management** (e-prescribing)

## 4. Post-Consultation Phase

### A. Orders & Prescriptions
- **Lab Orders** (follow-up tests, specialized tests)
- **Imaging Orders** (X-rays, CT, MRI if needed)
- **Referrals** (specialists, procedures)
- **Prescriptions** (medications, dosages, instructions)

### B. Follow-up Planning
- **Appointment Scheduling** (follow-up visits)
- **Patient Education** (condition explanation, self-care)
- **Care Instructions** (medication adherence, lifestyle changes)

## 5. Interoperability Features

### A. Data Exchange Standards
- **HL7 FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
- **DICOM** (medical imaging)
- **CCDA** (Continuity of Care Document)
- **X12** (insurance transactions)

### B. External System Integration
- **Lab Systems** (LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics)
- **Pharmacy Systems** (CVS, Walgreens, local pharmacies)
- **Imaging Centers** (radiology, cardiology)
- **Specialist Referrals** (other healthcare providers)

### C. Patient Portal Features
- **Appointment Management** (scheduling, rescheduling)
- **Test Results** (lab results, imaging reports)
- **Prescription Refills** (medication requests)
- **Health Records** (visit summaries, medical history)
