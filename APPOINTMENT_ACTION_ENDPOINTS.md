## 🔒 **Security Features:**

### **Authentication:**
```typescript
// Checks multiple sources
const token = bearerToken || accessToken || oldToken;

// Bearer token (mobile)
Authorization: Bearer <token>

// Cookies (web)
auth-token=<token>
access-token=<token>
```

### **Authorization:**
```typescript
// Verify doctor owns the appointment
if (appointment.doctor_id !== user.id && user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
  return 403 Unauthorized
}
```

### **CORS:**
```typescript
// All responses include CORS headers
return SecurityMiddleware.applyAPISecurityHeaders(response, origin);

// OPTIONS handler for preflight
export async function OPTIONS(request: NextRequest) {
  return SecurityMiddleware.applyAPISecurityHeaders(new NextResponse(null, { status: 204 }));
}
```
