‚îî‚îÄ Filtering happens at TIME SLOT level, not doctor list level

Current Implementation:

## üìä Database Verification Queries

### Check Doctor's Working Days:
```sql
SELECT 
  d.name, 
  d.availability_status,
  wd.day_of_week,
  wd.start_time,
  wd.end_time,
  wd.is_working,
  wd.break_start_time,
  wd.break_end_time
FROM doctor d
LEFT JOIN working_days wd ON d.id = wd.doctor_id
WHERE d.email = 'doctor2@hospital.com'
ORDER BY 
  CASE wd.day_of_week
    WHEN 'Monday' THEN 1
    WHEN 'Tuesday' THEN 2
    WHEN 'Wednesday' THEN 3
    WHEN 'Thursday' THEN 4
    WHEN 'Friday' THEN 5
    WHEN 'Saturday' THEN 6
    WHEN 'Sunday' THEN 7
  END;
```

### Check All Doctors' Availability:
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  specialization,
  availability_status,
  COUNT(wd.id) as working_days_count
FROM doctor
LEFT JOIN working_days wd ON doctor.id = wd.doctor_id AND wd.is_working = true
GROUP BY doctor.id, name, specialization, availability_status
ORDER BY name;
```

### Check User Accounts Created:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  d.name as doctor_name,
  d.specialization
FROM "user" u
LEFT JOIN doctor d ON u.id = d.id
WHERE u.role = 'DOCTOR'
ORDER BY u.email;
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Can't log in as doctor
**Cause:** User account not created  
**Solution:** Re-run updated seed with user creation

### Issue 2: No time slots showing
**Causes:**
1. Doctor has no working_days records
2. Selected day is marked is_working = false
3. Selected date is Saturday/Sunday (not working)

**Debug:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM working_days WHERE doctor_id = 'DOCTOR_ID_HERE';
```

### Issue 3: Lunch break not excluded
**Cause:** break_start_time or break_end_time is null  
**Solution:** Seed should set these to "12:00" and "13:00"

### Issue 4: All doctors showing in booking
**Question:** Should BUSY doctors show?

**Current Behavior:**
- ALL doctors show in list
- Filtering happens at TIME SLOT level

**To Change:**
Update `/api/doctors` endpoint to filter by availability_status:
```typescript
WHERE availability_status = 'AVAILABLE'
```
