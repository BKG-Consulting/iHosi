|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Test 1 | Modern UI works | Component → API → Database |

## 🔍 Debugging If Tests Fail

### Issue: Can't log in as doctor
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM "user" WHERE email = 'doctor2@hospital.com';
-- Should return 1 row with role = 'DOCTOR'
```
**Fix:** Re-run seed

---

### Issue: No time slots showing
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM working_days 
WHERE doctor_id = (SELECT id FROM doctor WHERE email = 'doctor2@hospital.com')
AND day_of_week = 'Monday';
-- Should return 1 row with is_working = true
```
**Fix:** Re-run seed with updated file

---

### Issue: Modern scheduling UI not showing
**Check:**
1. Go to `/doctor` route
2. See if "Scheduling" tab exists
3. If not, clear browser cache
4. Restart dev server

---

### Issue: Schedule changes don't reflect in booking
**Check:**
```sql
-- After changing doctor's schedule
SELECT day_of_week, start_time, end_time, is_working
FROM working_days
WHERE doctor_id = (SELECT id FROM doctor WHERE email = 'doctor2@hospital.com');
-- Verify changes saved
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Summary

### Doctor List in Patient Booking:
- **Shows:** ALL 10 doctors (regardless of availability_status)
- **Why:** Filtering happens at time slot level, not doctor list level
- **Future:** Could add visual indicators for BUSY doctors

### Time Slot Generation:
- **Based on:** working_days table (YOUR modern scheduling saves here!)
- **Respects:** is_working flag, start_time, end_time, break times
- **Filters:** Already booked slots
- **Real-time:** Changes to schedule reflect immediately

### Availability Toggle:
- **Updates:** doctor.availability_status field
- **Separate from:** working_days (by design)
- **Current:** Doesn't block booking (optional enhancement)
- **Purpose:** Internal status indicator

## 📞 Need Help?

**If something doesn't work:**

1. Check console logs (browser + terminal)
2. Verify database was reset: `npx prisma studio`
3. Look at `working_days` table (should have 70 rows: 10 doctors × 7 days)
4. Look at `user` table (should have 30 rows: 10 doctors + 20 patients)
5. Check that bcryptjs is installed: `npm list bcryptjs`

**Common fixes:**
- Clear browser cache/cookies
- Restart dev server
- Re-run seed: `npm run seed`
- Check you're using updated seed file
