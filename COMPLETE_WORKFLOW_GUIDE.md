- ✅ Linked to Boston Medical Center
- ✅ Password securely hashed
- ✅ Admin can now login

---

#### Step 4: Facility Admin Logs In
```bash
# Option A: Use facility subdomain (with /etc/hosts setup)
1. Visit: http://boston-medical.localhost:3000/sign-in
2. Email: sarah.johnson@boston-medical.ihosi.com
3. Password: BostonAdmin123!

## 🏗️ **Architecture Summary**

### What's Implemented:

```
Super Admin (admin.localhost:3000)
  ├── Creates facilities
  ├── Creates facility admins
  ├── Views system-wide stats
  └── Manages all facilities

Facility Admin (facility-slug.localhost:3000)
  ├── Sees facility-branded login
  ├── Dashboard shows facility name & colors
  ├── Stats filtered to their facility only
  ├── Can manage:
  │   ├── Doctors at their facility
  │   ├── Staff at their facility
  │   ├── Patients at their facility
  │   └── Appointments at their facility
  └── CANNOT see other facilities' data

Doctor (any facility)
  ├── Can work at multiple facilities
  ├── Sees unified calendar
  ├── Per-facility schedules
  └── Cross-facility conflict detection
```

---

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### New Tables Created:
1. `facilities` - Core facility table
2. `admins` - Super admin & facility admins
3. `doctor_facilities` - Doctors at multiple facilities
4. `patient_facilities` - Patients at multiple facilities
5. `staff_facilities` - Staff assignments
6. `facility_admins` - Admin assignments (old, keeping for compatibility)
7. `facility_working_days` - Per-facility schedules
8. `facility_departments` - Facility-department mapping
9. `appointment_types` - Facility-specific appointment types

### Key Relationships:
- Admin → Facility (one-to-one for facility admins)
- Doctor → Facilities (many-to-many via DoctorFacility)
- Patient → Facilities (many-to-many via PatientFacility)
- Appointment → Facility (many-to-one)

---

## 🔒 **Security & Isolation**

### Data Isolation Enforcement:

**Facility Admin Can:**
- ✅ View appointments where `facility_id` = their facility
- ✅ Manage doctors assigned to their facility
- ✅ See patients registered at their facility
- ✅ View their facility's analytics

**Facility Admin CANNOT:**
- ❌ See appointments from other facilities
- ❌ Access other facilities' patient data
- ❌ View system-wide statistics
- ❌ Create or manage other facilities

**Super Admin Can:**
- ✅ Create/edit/delete any facility
- ✅ Create facility admins
- ✅ View system-wide analytics
- ✅ Access all facilities' data
- ✅ Suspend/activate facilities

---

## 🎯 **Use Cases Covered**

### ✅ Use Case 1: Multi-Facility Hospital System
```
Boston Healthcare System has:
- Boston Medical Center (Main campus)
- Boston Medical East (Satellite)
- Boston Medical West (Satellite)

Each has:
- Own admin
- Own subdomain
- Own branding
- Shared doctors (work at multiple campuses)
```

### ✅ Use Case 2: Independent Clinics (SaaS)
```
Platform hosts multiple independent clinics:
- Smith Family Clinic (smith-clinic.ihosi.com)
- Jones Pediatrics (jones-pediatrics.ihosi.com)
- Downtown Urgent Care (downtown-urgent.ihosi.com)

Each has:
- Complete isolation
- Custom branding
- Own admin
- Own patient base
```

### ✅ Use Case 3: Regional Healthcare Networks
```
Regional network with facilities in different states:
- Texas Health North (texas-health-north.ihosi.com)
- Texas Health South (texas-health-south.ihosi.com)
- Texas Health Central (texas-health-central.ihosi.com)

Doctors can work across facilities
Unified scheduling
Regional admin oversight
```

---

## 📝 **API Endpoints Created**

### Super Admin APIs:
- `POST /api/super-admin/facilities` - Create facility
- `POST /api/super-admin/facility-admins` - Create facility admin

### Testing API:
- `GET /api/test-facility` - List all facilities

### Existing APIs (Now Facility-Aware):
- All appointment APIs filter by facility_id
- Admin dashboard filters by facility
- Doctor/patient/staff queries respect facility context

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### For Local Testing:

**Add to /etc/hosts:**
```bash
sudo bash setup-local-hosts.sh
```

Or manually add:
```
127.0.0.1 admin.localhost
127.0.0.1 mayo-clinic.localhost
127.0.0.1 boston-medical.localhost
# ... etc
```

### For Production:

**DNS Configuration:**
```
# Wildcard DNS
*.ihosi.com → Your server IP

# Or individual subdomains
admin.ihosi.com → Server IP
mayo-clinic.ihosi.com → Server IP
boston-medical.ihosi.com → Server IP
```

**SSL:**
```bash
# Wildcard SSL certificate
certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare \
  -d ihosi.com \
  -d *.ihosi.com
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://ihosi.com
DATABASE_URL=your-production-db-url
```

---

## 🎨 **Customization Examples**

### Custom Colors Per Facility:

**Mayo Clinic:**
- Primary: #0051C3 (Blue)
- Dashboard, buttons, links use this color

**Stanford Medical:**
- Primary: #8C1515 (Cardinal)
- Entire UI adapts to Stanford colors

**Custom CSS (Advanced):**
```sql
UPDATE facilities 
SET custom_css = '
  .header { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); }
  .button-primary { border-radius: 20px; }
'
WHERE slug = 'custom-facility';
```

---

## 🔍 **How Tenant Isolation Works**

### Request Flow:

```
1. User visits: boston-medical.localhost:3000/admin
   ↓
2. Middleware extracts subdomain: "boston-medical"
   ↓
3. Database lookup:
   SELECT * FROM facilities WHERE slug = 'boston-medical'
   ↓
4. Facility context injected:
   Headers: x-facility-id, x-facility-name
   Cookie: facility-context
   ↓
5. Admin page loads:
   getCurrentFacility() → Boston Medical Center
   ↓
6. Stats query filtered:
   WHERE facility_id = 'boston-medical-id'
   ↓
7. Dashboard shows ONLY Boston Medical data
```

### Query Examples:

**Before (No Isolation):**
```typescript
const appointments = await db.appointment.findMany({
  where: { status: 'SCHEDULED' }
});
// Returns ALL appointments from ALL facilities ❌
```

**After (With Isolation):**
```typescript
const facilityId = await getCurrentFacilityId();
const appointments = await db.appointment.findMany({
  where: { 
    facility_id: facilityId,
    status: 'SCHEDULED' 
  }
});
// Returns ONLY appointments from current facility ✅
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "Super admin can't login"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-run super admin seeder
npx ts-node scripts/seed-super-admin.ts

# Verify in database
npx prisma studio
# Check admins table
```

### Issue: "Facility admin sees all data"
**Check:**
1. Admin has facility_id set in database
2. getCurrentFacility() returns correct facility
3. Queries include facility_id filter

### Issue: "Subdomain not working"
**Check:**
1. /etc/hosts configured: `cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost`
2. Middleware logs show subdomain: Check terminal
3. Facility exists with that slug: Check Prisma Studio

### Issue: "Branding not applying"
**Check:**
1. Browser console for: "🎨 Branding applied"
2. Inspect element, check CSS variables
3. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
4. Facility has colors set in database

       doctor_id: "doctor-id",
       facility_id: "boston-medical-id",
       employment_type: "FULL_TIME",
       is_primary_facility: true,
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Per-Facility Schedules:**
   ```typescript
   await db.facilityWorkingDays.create({
     data: {
       doctor_facility_id: "...",
       day_of_week: "Monday",
       start_time: "09:00",
       end_time: "17:00",
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Unified Doctor Calendar:**
   - Show all appointments across all facilities
   - Color-coded by facility
   - Cross-facility conflict detection
