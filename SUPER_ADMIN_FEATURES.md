## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

Based on this comprehensive list, what would you like to implement next?

**Recommended Order:**
1. **Facility List View** - See all facilities in a nice table/grid
2. **Edit Facility** - Modify facility information
3. **Facility Details Page** - Deep dive into each facility
4. **Admin Management** - View/manage all facility admins
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - System-wide metrics and charts

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing the **Facility List View**?
2. Build the **Facility Details Page**?
3. Create the **Admin Management Dashboard**?
4. Focus on **Analytics & Charts**?
5. Something else?
