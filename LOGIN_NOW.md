## 🔥 **Quick Verification**

### Test Super Admin Exists:
```bash
# Check database
npx prisma studio --port 5555
# Visit http://localhost:5555
# Go to "admins" table
# Should see: superadmin@ihosi.com with is_super_admin = true
```

### Test API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-facility
# Should return 10 facilities
```

### Test Login:
```bash
# Browser: http://localhost:3000/sign-in
# Credentials above
```

---

## 🐛 **If Login Fails**

### Check 1: Server Running
```bash
lsof -i :3000
# Should show node process
```

### Check 2: Super Admin in Database
```bash
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=healthcare_pass healthcare-db \
  psql -U healthcare_user -d healthcare_db \
  -c "SELECT email, is_super_admin FROM admins;"
```

### Check 3: Regenerate Prisma
```bash
npx prisma generate
pkill -f "next dev"
npm run dev
```
